# Softlight Figma → HTML/CSS Converter

A web tool that converts a Figma **Frame** into downloadable **index.html** and **styles.css** files.  
Paste a Figma design link → click **Download Files** → get clean HTML & CSS output based on the original layout.

## Features

- Accepts any Figma `/design/` link (Made as per the input in the Problem Statement)
- Extracts and processes the selected frame
- Generates fully structured HTML
- Generates corresponding CSS 
- Scales the exported layout responsively in preview
- Downloads both files on single click

## How It Works

1. User pastes a Figma design URL.
2. The app extracts the **file key** from the entered link.
3. The Figma API is used to fetch the frame node data.
4. HTML is generated by walking the node tree.
5. CSS is generated based on each node’s styling.
6. The final files are downloaded automatically on click of Download Files button.
